    <h3>What is C Programming?</h3>
    <p align="justify">C (/siÀê/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.
    
    A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell LabsDennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It w  applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[6] During the 1980C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programmi  languages,[7][8] with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by t ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
